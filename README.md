# Cooling Load Calculator

# Description - 
Create a Python program that calculates the cooling load for a building based on user input.<br/>
# Objective:
Create a program using any language that calculates the cooling load for a building based on
user input.<br/>
# Instructions (Inputs) :
a.Area of the building (in square meters) <br/>
b.Number of occupants in the building <br/>
c.Type of building (residential, commercial, etc.) <br/>
d.Outdoor temperature (in Celsius) <br/>
e.Indoor desired temperature (in Celsius) <br/>
 
Based on the type of building, use the following formulae to calculate the cooling <br/>
1. ****load :**** <br/>
a.For residential buildings: Cooling Load = 100 * number of occupants<br/>
b.For commercial buildings: Cooling Load = 150 * number of occupants<br/>
2. ****Calculate the heat transfer due to conduction :****<br/>
a.Use the formula: Q_conduction = U * A * (T_outdoor - T_indoor)<br/>
b.Assume U (Overall heat transfer coefficient) = 30 W/m²°C for simplicity.<br/>
3. ****Calculate the sensible cooling load :****<br/>
a.Use the formula: Sensible Cooling Load = Q_conduction + Cooling Load<br/>
b.Display the final sensible cooling load to the user.<br/>

# Web Page Creation:
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create a simple web page to take user inputs for
the cooling load calculator and display the results.<br/>
# Deployment:
Deploy the web page using a free hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.<br/>

****For validating the above use the above code by use the following values****:<br/> 
a.Area of the building (500 square meters)<br/>
b.Number of occupants in the building (10)<br/>
c.Type of building (residential,)<br/>
d.Outdoor temperature (45°C)<br/>
e.Indoor desired temperature (17°C)<br/>
